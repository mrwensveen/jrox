Client and server library to support JSON-RPC over XMPP (jabber). Uses jabsorb (http://jabsorb.org) to provide JSON-RPC and Smack (http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/) for XMPP communication.

Future plans include javascript client and server libraries for java-js and js-js RPC.

Note: jrox currently depends on the trunk of jabsorb with some patches. These patches are provided within this project, but it is something you should be aware of. The patches are submitted upstream and it is expected that they will be committed and make some future release.
